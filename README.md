Abstract.
There has been a rise in interest in the creation of recommendation systems for a variety of sectors, notably e-commerce, social networks, and music, in recent years.
These systems aim to present users with personalized recommendations based on their interests and past conduct.
In the context of recipe recommendations, this involves identifying users' dietary restrictions and preferences, as well as the ingredients they have available,
to suggest recipes that are suitable for them. Several approaches have been proposed for developing recipe recommendation systems, including ingredient-based clustering algorithms,
machine learning techniques that utilize features such as title or price tags to identify products, and hybrid systems that combine content-based and collaborative filtering.
Ingredient-based clustering algorithms group recipes based on their ingredients, which can help to identify recipes that are similar in terms of their ingredients and flavours.
Machine learning techniques, such as neural networks and decision trees, can be used to identify patterns in users' behaviour and preferences and make recommendations based on those patterns.
Hybrid systems combine both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches to generate more accurate and diverse recommendations.

Keywords.
Personalized recommendations, content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, machine learning, ingredient-based clustering, and knowledge-based approach.
